# Storage

All files will be stored in two locations:

- Data files
  - Default Storage location shall be in a common space such as AppData on Windows
  - Shall only contain text files for things like shared sections, and saved sections
- Media files
  - This is for raw media files. This is the default media library for the whole system and allows for referencing common images.

## Data files

The Default data file structure shall be as follows

- Sections: contains pre-saved sections
- Songs: Contains saved songs including arrangements
- Configs: Stores any system level configs
- Playlists: Default save location for playlists. Playlists may be exported and imported

## Media Files

Media files shall be separated into types:

- Images
- Videos

Each image and video will only be loaded when I playlist has that image/video.

When I user puts an image/video into Presenter a copy of the image/video shall be made and placed into the image/video folder.

### Data Management

Due to system size limitations a "clean media" function shall exist such that when executed all playlist media references shall be checked. If an image/video is not referenced by a playlist then the media shall be deleted.
