# Slide

A slide is a single presentation "moment" in the presentation. It includes a set of layers. By default Presenter will only have a Forground and Background element.

Each layer will be added in sequential order.

```yaml
slide:
  base: <color-code>
  background: /path/to/img
  forground: <details>
```
