# presenter

A Open Source Presentation Software for Churches based on Rust and Tauri. This project is intended to be a rapid deploy solution for churches using other products, but be free and user centered.

A core philosophy behind all Transept software is the idea of File over app. All data used in this project is your data, and will stay that way. This means that we _must_ deliver on a quality user experience to be competitive because we don't want to trap you in our ecosystem.
